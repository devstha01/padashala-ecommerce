                Once we receive notification that you wish to withdraw your consent for receiving marketing or
                promotional materials or communications, it may take up to thirty (30) days for your withdrawal to be
                reflected in our systems. Therefore, you may still receive marketing or promotional materials or
                communications during this period.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you withdraw your consent to receive marketing or promotional materials through a specific
                communication mode (e.g. SMS), we may still contact you for other purposes in relation to the products
                and services via other communication modes you have subscribed to (e.g. email).
                <br>

                You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of any of your Personal Data in
                our possession or under our control by submitting a written request via email to our Data Protection
                Officer. Note that, depending on the nature of the consent withdrawal, we may not be able to continue to
                provide you with some or all of our products or services. We will process such a request within a
                reasonable time from receiving notice from you of your withdrawal of consent. Once the processing is
                complete, we will no longer collect, use and/or disclose your Personal Data, except to the extent we
                retain your Personal Data for compliance, regulatory or other legal purposes.
                <br>
            </p>
            <h4>ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL DATA</h4>
            <p>

                We will make reasonable efforts to ensure Personal Data likely to be used by us or disclosed by us to
                another organization is accurate and complete. However, you should update us of any changes in your
                Personal Data. We will not be responsible for relying on inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data if you
                have not updated us of changes.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will also put in place reasonable security arrangements to ensure that your Personal Data is
                adequately protected and secured. This includes putting in place reasonable measures to prevent any
                unauthorized or accidental access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, leakage, loss,
                damage, erasure, or alteration of your Personal Data. However, we will not be responsible for any
                unauthorized or accidental access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, leakage, loss,
                damage, erasure, or alteration of Personal Data by third parties which is attributable to factors beyond
                our control.
                <br>
                <br>
                When Personal Data in our possession is (i) no longer required for any reason connected to the purpose
                it was originally collected or (ii) retention by us is no longer necessary for any other legal or
                business purposes, we will exercise measures to ensure such Personal Data is either destroyed or
                anonymised.
                <br>
                <br>
                If Personal Data is transferred out of Hong Kong, we will comply with Applicable Laws in doing so. This
                includes: (i) obtaining your consent, unless an exception exists under Applicable Laws or any other
                laws, and (ii) taking reasonable steps to ascertain whether the foreign recipient of the Personal Data
                is bound to comply with standards of protection that are at least comparable to the Applicable Laws.

            <h4>INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</h4>
            <p>

                If you are located in the European Economic Area, you may seek confirmation regarding whether GOLDENGATE
                is processing your Personal Data, request access to your Personal Data and ask that we correct, amend,
                delete, or restrict processing of your Personal Data. In addition, you may object to GOLDENGATE’s
                processing of your Personal Data at any time. However, please note that doing so may impact your ability
                to access and use GOLDENGATE ’s Platforms and services.
                <br>
                <br>
                While GOLDENGATE makes reasonable efforts to provide our users with access to their Personal Data, there
                may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide such access, including but not limited to: where
                the information in question is legally privileged, would compromise the privacy or other legitimate
                rights of other persons, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to
                the risks to your privacy, where the request is clearly excessive or unfounded, or where the information
                requested comprises proprietary business information.
